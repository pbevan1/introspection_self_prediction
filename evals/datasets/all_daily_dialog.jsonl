Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement . Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day \u2019 s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect .\nUser 2: Cool !

Let's get started. As you know, an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system. It is not enough to simply memorize our laws, it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed. This brings me to our topic for today. Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first?\n\nUser 2: Cinco de mayo?\n\nUser 1: No, that's May fifth in Spanish, James, no wonder you are failing my Spanish class. No, May first is International Workers' Day.\n\nUser 2: Do we get a day off from school then?\n\nUser 1: No! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US, but in other countries it is.\n\nUser 2: Wow, man!\n\nUser 1: In the nineteenth century, working conditions were appalling, with workers being forced to work ten, twelve, and fourteen hours a day. Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly, despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders, and by April 1886, 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement. Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed, so labor organizers took drastic measures. They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day's work. And, on May First 1886, the resolution took effect.\n\nUser 2: Cool! Is that why we only work eight hours now?\n\nUser 1: Yes! But the happy ending came at a high price. On May third, 1886, police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory, killing four and wounding many.

How can an indiscretion last two months? I mean, you two have been married for two years!

Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed, so labor organizers took drastic measures. They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day's work. And, on May First 1886, the resolution took effect.\n\nUser 2: Cool! Is that why we only work eight hours now?\n\nUser 1: Yes! But the happy ending came at a high price. On May third, 1886, police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory, killing four and wounding many. A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality.\n\nUser 2: And then what happened?\n\nUser 1: Well, as we say, the rest is history...\n\nUser 2:"}}

And the more you drink, the more you talk. It makes me so relaxed.\nUser 1: When did you begin to drink?\nUser 2: It's a long time ago. When I first went to a bar to pick up girls there, I saw the most beautiful girl sitting and sipping a coke. Then I went up to her and said 'can I buy you a drink?'\nUser 1: And then?\nUser 2: Then I talked to her and got her number. You know what? When you don't know what to say? Just drink.\nUser 1: So you get drunk every day?\nUser 2:"}}

Brown is the new black.\nUser 2: Why don't you just get black? Black suits are always fashionable and can be worn for anything \u2014 a funeral, a wedding, a job interview \u2014 anything!\nUser 1: That may be true, but black is so boring. Anyway, I already have three black suits. I might as well get a suit that stands out from the rest.\nUser 2: Here are two different shades of brown. Which one do you prefer?\nUser 1: I like the one on the left, but I don't like the pattern on it. It's too much. I want a pattern that's a bit subtler.\nUser 2: How about this one?\nUser 1: I think that will do. Let's go talk to the tailor about getting it made.\nUser 2: Ok, let's go.\nUser 1:"}}

How about going dancing? We haven't done that in a while. There's a club in Silver Lake that's supposed to be hopping on Friday nights. Eddie from work told me that they have a really good DJ and a big dance floor, and the cover charge isn't bad.\nUser 1: I'm not really in the mood for dancing, actually. You know what? I just feel like staying home tonight and vegging, after all. How about you?\nUser 2: Yeah, I was hoping you'd say that. It's nice to have the option to go out but I'd rather stay in. Maybe we can go out tomorrow night.\nUser 1: Yeah, definitely, tomorrow night.\nUser 2:"}}

Little accessories for young people. But the reason these will sell is the logo. Just like Hello Kitty.\nUser 2: I understand. But why won't you show me the logo?\nUser 1: Because it hasn't been copyrighted. We want to get some protection for it. But while we wait for copyright, we are investigating companies to produce the products.\nUser 2: I see. The problem, however, is that I can't be confident in giving you a good price less I am confident your product will last.\nUser "}}

The seller sets a preposterous price, and the buyer tries his best to bring it down, until a compromise is reached. Yet you ignored the process. No wonder you ended up easy prey.\nUser 1: But don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin?\nUser 2: Of course, that's something really irritating. And the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff. I recommend you to consult the price tags in the supermarket first. And then you may negotiate for a fair deal.\nUser 1:"}}

Thus, after shipment it will be four to five weeks altogether before the goods can reach our retailers. The goods must therefore be shipped before October; otherwise we won't be in time for the selling season.\nUser 2: But our factories are fully committed for the third quarter. In fact, many of our clients are placing orders for delivery in the fourth quarter.\nUser 1: Mr. Brown, you certainly realize that the time of delivery is a matter of great importance to us. If we place our goods on the market at a time when all other importers have already sold their goods at profitable prices, we shall lose out.\nUser 2: I see your point. However, we have done more business this year than any of the previous years. I am very sorry to say that we cannot advance the time of delivery.\nUser 1: That's too bad, but I sincerely hope you will give our request your special consideration.\nUser 2: You may take it from me that the last thing we want to do is to disappoint an old customer like you. But the fact remains that our manufacturers have a heavy backlog on their hands.\nUser 1: But can't you find some way to get round your producers for an earlier delivery? Make a special effort, please. A timely delivery means a lot to us.\nUser 2: All right. We'll get in touch with our producers and see what they have to say.\nUser 1:"}}

We plan to contact www.online-advertising.com.cn and Shanghai Morning Newspaper to discuss the advertisement schedule.\nUser 2: I think the idea is very good. In the promotion campaign, two or more media are used together, so as to draw customers' attention and keep hold their attention to a larger extent.\nUser 1: What kind of media do you recommend?\nUser 2: I think TV is also an effective media, as long as our company is willing to spend more money on it.\nUser 1: Well. Arden just mentioned the paper and the on-sales. And I can talk about TV with him later, because TV promotion gets more and more popular among consumers.\nUser 2: I also think good advertising is essential to call attention to a product and introduce our L-series products. Meanwhile, ads are also the representation of the company's image.\nUser 1:"}}
